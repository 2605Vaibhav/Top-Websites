    <h1>What should be your FIRST WEBSITE?</h1>
    <h2>Top 10 websites you can develop as a beginer.</h2>
    <h3>1. Memes Generator</h3>
    <p>A meme is “…a virally-transmitted cultural symbol or social idea” (source). Meme Generator is a web-based tool that allows users to quickly and easily create their own visual image meme. In this case, a meme is media content  that usually consists of a popular image and typically two sections of text: one at the top and one at the bottom. Memes can convey a wide variety of messages and intent (i.e. humor, politics, education). </p>
    <p>Created in 2009, MemeGenerator.net was the first online meme generator and today, continues to give users the ability to create memes free-of-charge and avoid the tedious proccess of repetedly copying images into a program and adding text sections manually. Overall, Meme Generator is a great tool to use as a means of breaking up students’ projects or presentations. It can be used to highlight a key concept by making it jump out from the rest of the material and its often-humorous nature can help boost retention of the content (source). Employing modern slang and pop culture references also furthers this tool’s use as an effective, simple means of making subject matter more relatable to the students.</p>

    <h3>7. Interviews Site</h3>
    <p>This idea is for anyone who likes to talk to interesting people and hear fascinating stories.

    <p>Now that you have some ideas about the topic of your site, let's talk about the technical part of actually setting up your website.</p>

    <h3>9. Membership websites</h3>
    <p>If you’re already blogging, creating tutorials, or are thinking about launching an online course of your own, membership websites make it easy to get paid for what you create. There are many types of websites that offer memberships that unlock premium content that’s not available anywhere else.</p>
    <p>Most offer a basic level — giving people a taste of what’s available for free and then enticing them to sign up for their premium memberships. Becoming a paying member unlocks exclusive content like step-by-step tutorials, online courses, articles, videos, message forums where experts share tips, and more. </p>

    <p>The Oasis with Jennifer Louden is a great example of a membership site. Members who pay a monthly subscription receive access to a library of inspirational audio/video resources, writing and business practice tips, live monthly calls, and more. </p>
    <p>If you’re looking for a great website idea to make money off of your content, building a membership website is a solid avenue.</p>


    <h3>10. Affiliate sites</h3>
    <p>An affiliate website offers an online store of products and resources in a specific niche. Think of them as digital boutiques catering to the tastes and interests of a select demographic.</p>
    <p>A great example of an affiliate site is Raymmar’s Reads — which functions as a digital book club where Raymmar shares books he likes and includes Amazon affiliate links. Raymmar uses 3D animations and nice color-shifting background transitions to make this simple site stand out. </p>

    <h2>Website Design Ideas</h2>
    <p>Creating a website can be quite challenging for beginners. Most people don't know where to start. They might want to start with a simple website builder, but then realize that it doesn't have all the features they need. A platform like WordPress or Magento can seem daunting to beginners. It's all about figuring out what your needs are.</p>
    <p>Here are a few criteria to consider before picking your ideal website platform.</p>
    <p>Price - What is your monthly budget?</p>
    <p>Expertise - How savvy are you with web design or website building platforms?</p>
    <p>Goals - What are your goals? Do you want to set up an online shop? A blog? A review site?</p>
    <p>Integrations - Make sure the platform you're considering has all the integrations that you need. These could include integrations to payment portals, email marketing tools, content syndication, or shopping carts.</p>
    <p>SEO - Remember to check the technical setup of the site. Does your platform have all the technical aspects of SEO set up? Will search engines recognize and be able to easily crawl your site and rank it on relevant search results?</p>
    <p>Answer these questions for yourself, do some research, and come up with three possible solutions for your website setup. That will make it easier for you to make a good decision. Once you select the best option, then you can dig deep into the requirements of that particular website builder or platform. And if you get stuck, you can always get a developer to help you finalize the project.</p>
